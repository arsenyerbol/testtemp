    "Model: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\n",
    "The challenge of this project is to accurately predict the future closing value of a given stock across a given period of time in the future. For this project I will use a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict the closing price of the S&P 500 Index using a dataset of past prices based on closing price of the Trump Twitter Index.\n",
    "\n",
    "This program uses an artificial recurrent neural network called Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) to predict the closing stock price of the S&P500 Index, using the past 30 day stock price of the Trump Twitter Index.\n",
    "\n",
    "Long short-term memory (LSTM) is an artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture used in the field of deep learning. Unlike standard feed forward neural networks, LSTM has feedback connections. It can not only process single data points (such as images), but also entire sequences of data (such as speech or video).\n",
    "\n",
    "LSTMs are widely used for sequence prediction problems and have proven to be extremely effective. The reason they work so well is because LSTM is able to store past information that is important, and forget the information that is not.\n",

    "Input gate: The input gate adds information to the cell state\n",
    "Forget gate: It removes the information that is no longer required by the model\n",
